    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>Imagine a shoe where you could create any pattern you wanted. Imagine being able to produce artwork and uploading it to your phone where you had the option to display it right on your shoes.</p>
    <p>The microfibres on the shoe would be made from a special material that would allow the surface of the shoe to change from the press of a button on the app. The material on the shoe would get shocked and the shock would be sent from the app on your phone.</p>

    <h2>Create. Upload. Adjust. Stylize.</h2>
    <p>Create your artwork in Illustrator with any design you like, upload your artwork to the app, adjust any minor changes needed and then finalize the design and wear your style.</p>
